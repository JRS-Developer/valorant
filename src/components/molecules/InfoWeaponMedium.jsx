            headshot damage: Two headshots <br />
            to kill an armored enemy at 20 meters, <br />
            and three shots at above 20 meters.

            Primary fire: Using Spectre primary fire is very good in close range
            and can stealth eliminate the enemy before they know where you
            shooting from.{" "}

        <p class="info-weapon-medium-txt">
            Alternative fire: When using alternative fire in Spectre, it turn on
            the scope that help reduce recoil, and improve accuracy a little,
            however the fire rate will drop to 12. Use Alternative fire when the
            enemy is far from you.

            Aim for Head: Using Spectre is better when you aim at head area
            because it can help eliminate the enemy quicker, aiming at body area
            is not very effective because of the fire rate is not that fast.{" "}

            Best time to use Spectre: The best time to use Spectre is in force
            buy rounds, or after you win pistol round.
