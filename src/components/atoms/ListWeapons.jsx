                The Rifle shines on the defensive side, as with its extreme damage per bullet and 1.5x zoom makes it a dangerous rifle to peek, especially since it's a guaranteed one tap to the head.`,

                infoFirst: `The Spectre is a moderately-priced submachine gun that occupies its wielder's primary weapon slot. It is outfitted with a silencer that reduces the range of the weapon's audio profile. In comparison to the Stinger, it is substantially more accurate, kicks considerably less, possesses slightly more cover piercing capability, and has a higher magazine capacity (30 as opposed to 20). However, its slightly lower per-shot damage and lessened fire rate render its total output statistically lower.`,
                infoSecond: `The weapon is a useful force buy if your team is strapped for cash, and is markedly effective at close ranges, especially on unarmoured targets. Its quietened firing sound can also come in handy for ambushing enemies, as less alert players may not have their attention drawn by your shots. However, as players acquire higher-damage rifles, it loses its effectiveness later in the game, where its role is better filled by the Phantom assault rifle, which, like the Spectre, is suppressed, and, differently, has the potential to kill an enemy in a single headshot (granted that the target lacks sufficient armor points), and has a much greater effective range with better penetration capability.`,

                The main disadvantage of the Sheriff is in its long pullout time and severe recoil. It has the most recoil of any pistol and takes quite a bit of time to recover.`,

                The Bulldog is unique for having a relatively low cost compared to the other fully automatic rifles at 2100. This makes it a useful force buy for eco rounds if your team lacks money. However, it costs significantly more than SMGs`,
                infoSecond: `It also has a 3 round burst, unlike other rifles, which can be good for close quarters. However, the spread significantly increases at medium to long ranges, so you'll want to use its primary fire otherwise.
                The ADS is good for supporting an assault on a site or holding a site down, as it increases aim and reduces recoil and spread (Overall makes the weapon more accurate).`,

                infoFirst: `The Stinger sits at 1100 credits and is unique for its high fire rate and short range.

                It has an alternate fire mode when aiming down sights, consisting of a four round burst with tighter spread and less recoil. This can be effective at close range to instantly head-burst someone, or at medium range to rapidly finish off a wounded target, however sustained DPS is very low in this fire mode and accuracy is still poor.`,
                infoSecond: `The Stinger is useful for buys when your team does not have sufficient credits for rifles, and cannot afford the Spectre, but still wants to compete at close range with enemies that purchased higher credit guns. The Stinger can only be used effectively at very close ranges, where it's high DPS can be put into use while minimizing the loss of damage caused by the high spread. Considering the low capacity size of 20 shots per magazine, it is still important to make every shot count, especially when facing more than one enemy, as burning through all of its bullets in a few milliseconds is a crippling disadvantage using the Stinger brings. It is also important to learn when to pull down during its intense recoil pattern.`,

                Compared to most other weapons, the Classic does a meager amount of damage. However, its nonexistent price tag makes it effective for rounds in which the player or team wishes to save credits for later rounds.
                
                Due to its low damage output, the Classic requires more shots than most in order to score a kill. Typically, a player with the Classic must hit two or three shots to the head, 7 to the body, or 8 to the legs.`,
                infoSecond: `The Classic has an alternate fire (right-click default). It fires a three-shot burst with moderate spread. Due to this unique mechanic, the Classic is fairly versatile and is viable at both short and medium ranges. This flexibility gives it an edge over other secondary weapons, which typically are only suited for a particular firing range. For example, the Shorty and Frenzy are viable almost exclusively at short ranges, while the Ghost and Sheriff are typically used for mid-range combat.`,
